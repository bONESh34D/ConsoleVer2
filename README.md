# ConsoleVer2
WindowsConsoleApp C# - Connect to SQL Utility DB to pull down a column from a view, User enters data, assign to var, send var as parameters to a Stored Proc in the Utility DB. This will be used to allow internal IT (SQL) devs to refresh lower environment databases by sending the necessary parameters that the StoredProc needs. This process already works on the SQL side.
